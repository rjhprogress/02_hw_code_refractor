<p>Existing code has been refactored to follow semantic structure of HTML elements. 
This is was done to ensure Web accessibility for all users. The semantic structure of HTML elements is an extremely important
consideration. It allows people with disabilities or social economic restrictions
to have access of the websites content. Codebase has also been made more efficient 
by consolidating CSS selectors and properties for long term sustainability. </p>

<p>The technologies used to build this website are HTML, and CSS.</p>

<h2>The semantic elements I applied to the code casebase, which fall in sequential order are:</h2>
header, nav, main, section, article, aside, and footer.
